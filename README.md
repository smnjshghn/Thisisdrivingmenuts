This is a personal project that provides the Feelings Wheel and uses Highcharts. If you click on first/second feelings you can see their subset feelings. 
If you click on any feeling the path will be copied to clipboard. I was inspired by and used some of the code from https://codepen.io/mushigh and https://github.com/namin/feel/.
